        <h1>Hi, I'm Devon.</h1>

        <p>I'm a software developer interested in data engineering, application integration, and technical architecture. I work for <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> as principal software engineer and EAI development team lead. I live in Lorain, Ohio with my wife, Chrissie.</p>

        <img src="{% static 'img/dbiere/devon_dogs_pic.jpg' %}" class="float-right db-profile-pic">

        <p>I grew up in Cincinnati where I had the incredible good luck to attend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_for_Creative_and_Performing_Arts">School for Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA)</a>. I studied Music Education at Ohio State and still love to <a href="https://devdogmusic.com">write and arrange music</a> when I get time, although my few pro credits are long behind me.</p>

        <h2>Random Bits</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>I love to learn. I always have a book in my hands or a podcast in my earbuds.</li>
            <li>When I was a kid, my dream jobs were typist, animator, astronaut, ILM special effects artist, and film music composer. If my 7-year-old self could see me now, spending 90% of my day typing, he would be ecstatic.</li>
            <li>My favorite movie is <em>The Princess Bride</em>. I saw it in the theater when it first came out. I don't think I've ever been part of a more surprised and insantaneous shout of laughter from an audience than when Peter Cook as the "Impressive Clergyman" opened his mouth and said, "Mawwiage". It's a perfect movie.</li>
            <li>My favorite non-fiction book is <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson.</li>
            <li>My name is pronounced DEH-vin bee-AIR.</li>
        </ul>
